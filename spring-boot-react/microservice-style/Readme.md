# Resource Server

This is a simple spring boot application. Import it directly to your favorite IDE.
In the controller, without adding the @CrossOrigin, the client can't access the resources.
Run it as Spring Boot Application, it will start at port 8081

# Client application

This is a very simple client app, directly generated as react typeScript application.
There is no reactive or timeout function added, so be sure to refresh the browser after each new entry of person/employee.
